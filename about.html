    <p>Hello! I’m a college student majoring in Computer Science with a growing love for technology, building things that work (and occasionally crash), and solving puzzles with code. I'm currently learning the fundamentals of programming, web development, and electronics—and having a blast doing it.</p>

    <p>Whether it's debugging a stubborn piece of C++ code or getting an LED to blink on an Arduino board, I find joy in the little wins and lessons along the way. Every bug is a mini-mystery waiting to be cracked.</p>

    <p>When I’m not buried in code, you might find me collaborating in student coding clubs, volunteering at campus events, or watching videos on how the internet actually works. I believe in learning by doing, failing forward, and always staying curious.</p>

    <p>My long-term goal? To become a developer who builds tools that empower others—and to never stop learning.</p>
